# Numeral Converter

The numeral converter is Roman to Arabic and vice-versa convert. This project was built as a prerequisite to attend [Andela's bootcamp](https://andela.com). 

The application takes a single argument and converts between the two numerals depending on the type of input it received then offers suggestions and insight into when an input is out of order or can be re-arranged to make sense.
